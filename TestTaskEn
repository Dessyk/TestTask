You should create a console application, that will calculate the cost of a beverage with additives. 

Beverages:

1)Coffee - Id - 1; - Cost $15
2)Tea - Id - 2; - Cost $10

Additives only for coffee:
1) Chocolate topping - Id - 1; - Cost $2

Additives for both tea and coffee:
1)Milk - Id - 3; - Cost $2
2)Sugar - Id - 4; - Cost $1
3)Cinnamon - Id - 5; - Cost $3
4)Lemon - Id - 6; - Cost $1

The input is given the beverage identifier, and then the identifiers of the additives, separated by commas.
On the output, we get a string with cost.

Example:
Enter a beverage: 1
Enter additives: 4,3,4,1
Cost: $21

a possibility of extension (extend drink lists and/or additives, use of a database, etc.).

The result of the task is a ready project with source codes and unit tests(if needed), which can be compiled.

You can use any tools that you want.
